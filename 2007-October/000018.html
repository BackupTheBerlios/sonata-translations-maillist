&gt;<i> Hi Sonata translators and maintainers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've created a danish translation of Sonata, my favourite interface to
</I>&gt;<i> my favourite music player (the latter is because of the former). The
</I>&gt;<i> translation is attached.
</I>
Thanks for the kind words and the translation :)

&gt;<i> I have translated everything except the error
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Sonata failed to connect to the D-BUS session bus: Unable to determine
</I>&gt;<i> the address of the message bus (try 'man dbus-launch' and 'man
</I>&gt;<i> dbus-daemon' for help)&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> I can easily translate it, but I thought that it might be easier for
</I>&gt;<i> users to get help when the error-message is something more people (that
</I>&gt;<i> is; not only Danes) can read. Should I add the translation or not? The
</I>&gt;<i> other error-messages are easier to understand and I think that most
</I>&gt;<i> people would be able to solve those problems them self, or said in
</I>&gt;<i> another way: this was the only error-message i didn't fully understand
</I>&gt;<i> myself (D-BUS?).
</I>
Most people should never encounter this error message. And, to be
honest, I stole this warning message from thunar (xfce's file manager)
and figured it to be a decent default. If you or anyone else has a
suggestion, I'd certainly consider it.

&gt;<i>         The text for the second tab in the &quot;song info&quot; dialog is &quot;_Cover
</I>&gt;<i>         Art&quot; in the code (sonata.py) and &quot;C_over Art&quot; in the translation
</I>&gt;<i>         files? I kept the one in the translation file and modified my
</I>&gt;<i>         sonata.py to get it to show op correctly.
</I>
Are you sure you're looking at the svn version of the sonata? Sonata
in svn (which will be the upcoming release) also now uses &quot;C_over Art&quot;
because of a conflict with the close button.

&gt;<i>         In the same dialog, on the lyrics tab. There is a search button
</I>&gt;<i>         the shortcut for it (ALT+S) is the same as one of the tabs...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         The &quot;by&quot; and &quot;from&quot; in the following line of code should maybe
</I>&gt;<i>         be customisable from translation files?
</I>&gt;<i>             self.currsongformat2 = &quot;by %A from %B&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>         The same with the name of the default profile
</I>
Good call on these, I will fix these for the subsequent release.

&gt;<i>         I couldn't find the description of the &quot;CTRL+J&quot; shortcut in the
</I>&gt;<i>         messages.po file. I just added a line for it to the translation
</I>&gt;<i>         file.
</I>
Ctrl-J is no longer a shortcut in the upcoming release, its action is
the default action when you simply press a key.

&gt;<i> Some more bugs, not translation-related:
</I>&gt;<i>         &amp; &quot; and other entities displayed wrongly in lyrics and
</I>&gt;<i>         the genre chooser (in the tag editor). I was listening to B.B.
</I>&gt;<i>         King's &quot;Why I sing the blues&quot; when I saw this: &quot;&amp;quot;You
</I>&gt;<i>         haven't been around long enough&amp;quot;&quot; Maybe just a problem
</I>&gt;<i>         with the specific lyric?
</I>
Interesting.. Can you send me this music file (<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sonata-translations">stonecrest at gmail.com</A>)
so I can investigate? I haven't seen this before.

&gt;<i>         The right-click menu disappears when the mouse button is
</I>&gt;<i>         released I'm using Ubuntu 7.10. It happens with both the version
</I>&gt;<i>         in the repository and the one from the sonata website.
</I>
This happens everytime? I've had a report about this from someone in
the past, but I've never experienced it even once myself.

&gt;<i>         The &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;--status&quot; argument in the man-page isn't really
</I>&gt;<i>         there. It's just &quot;status&quot;.
</I>
Hmm? There is no man page.. and it shows up correctly in sonata --help.

&gt;<i>         A specific search tab instead of the one in the bottom of the
</I>&gt;<i>         Library or at least some global accessible jump-to-search
</I>&gt;<i>         shortcut.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Easier access to the &quot;song info&quot; dialog than the &quot;right-click
</I>&gt;<i>         the top-part&quot;. Maybe a shortcut?
</I>
If you could add these to
<A HREF="https://developer.berlios.de/feature/?group_id=7323,">https://developer.berlios.de/feature/?group_id=7323,</A> that'd be great.
And please expand on the first one, maybe with an example, because I
don't entirely understand it at first glance.

&gt;<i>         A way to align some text to the right in the current playlist,
</I>&gt;<i>         maybe with a special syntax or just a special field in the song
</I>&gt;<i>         formatting tab. I would use this to display the length of the
</I>&gt;<i>         tracks in the playlist.
</I>
This is available in the upcoming release (user-configurable columns).

Scott
