<PRE>Hi Sonata translators and maintainers

I've created a danish translation of Sonata, my favourite interface to
my favourite music player (the latter is because of the former). The
translation is attached. I have translated everything except the error
&quot;Sonata failed to connect to the D-BUS session bus: Unable to determine
the address of the message bus (try 'man dbus-launch' and 'man
dbus-daemon' for help)&quot;.
I can easily translate it, but I thought that it might be easier for
users to get help when the error-message is something more people (that
is; not only Danes) can read. Should I add the translation or not? The
other error-messages are easier to understand and I think that most
people would be able to solve those problems them self, or said in
another way: this was the only error-message i didn't fully understand
myself (D-BUS?).

I discovered some errors while doing the translation, they are here:

        The text for the second tab in the &quot;song info&quot; dialog is &quot;_Cover
        Art&quot; in the code (sonata.py) and &quot;C_over Art&quot; in the translation
        files? I kept the one in the translation file and modified my
        sonata.py to get it to show op correctly.
        
        In the same dialog, on the lyrics tab. There is a search button
        the shortcut for it (ALT+S) is the same as one of the tabs...
        
        The &quot;by&quot; and &quot;from&quot; in the following line of code should maybe
        be customisable from translation files?
            self.currsongformat2 = &quot;by %A from %B&quot;
        The same with the name of the default profile

	I couldn't find the description of the &quot;CTRL+J&quot; shortcut in the 
	messages.po file. I just added a line for it to the translation 
	file.
        
Some more bugs, not translation-related:
	&amp; &quot; and other entities displayed wrongly in lyrics and
        the genre chooser (in the tag editor). I was listening to B.B.
        King's &quot;Why I sing the blues&quot; when I saw this: &quot;&amp;quot;You
        haven't been around long enough&amp;quot;&quot; Maybe just a problem
        with the specific lyric?

        The right-click menu disappears when the mouse button is
        released I'm using Ubuntu 7.10. It happens with both the version
        in the repository and the one from the sonata website.
        
        The &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;--status&quot; argument in the man-page isn't really
        there. It's just &quot;status&quot;.

And I also have some requests for features (yeah this is probably the 
wrong place for these, where should I add them?):
        
        A specific search tab instead of the one in the bottom of the
        Library or at least some global accessible jump-to-search
        shortcut.
        
        Easier access to the &quot;song info&quot; dialog than the &quot;right-click
        the top-part&quot;. Maybe a shortcut?
        
        A way to align some text to the right in the current playlist,
        maybe with a special syntax or just a special field in the song
        formatting tab. I would use this to display the length of the
        tracks in the playlist.
